1.Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset - building an image recognizing algorithm for cat/non cat binary classifier from scratch
	Reshape dimensions
	Standardization
	Compute Cost, Update Parameters using GD, predict W and b
	Prediction
	Learning rates analysis

2.Neural Network with one hidden layer on a Linearly Non Seperable dataset
	compare and contrast with Logistic regression
	test for additional layers - Impact of overfitting

3.Deep Neural Network - 2 Layers and L Layers:
	Use of ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for output layer
	Linear Forward, Activation Forward, Cost Function (Store necessary values in cache)
	Backward Prop - Sigmoid, Relus, INput -- get gradients with respect to cost
	Update Parameters to get Weights and Bias using Grad Descent
	Predictions
	Learning Rates analysis - Early stopping
	Analysis of mislabelled images - Identify failure pattern
